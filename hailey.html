<h1>To mi Pares</h1>
<pre>
I hope our story together
never ends.

To me, you are the rain.
You gave me something I cannot regain.
My very own life.
May I also help you in your life.

A debt I can never repay.
Something that can never decay,
"Liebe" was it?
"Ai" was it?

Mein Partner,
may we never part ways.
My Partner,
may we meet in places.
