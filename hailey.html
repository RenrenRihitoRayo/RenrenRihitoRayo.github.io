<h1>Mi Vaio <div class="orange">Pares<div></h1>
<pre>
I hope our story together
never ends.

To me, you are the rain.
You gave me something I cannot regain.
My very own life.
May I also help you in your life.

A debt I can never repay.
Something that can never decay,
"Liebe" was it?
"Ai" was it?

Mein Partner,
may we never part ways.
My Partner,
may we always meet in places.

Oh when I meant you are the rain?
Its because even when Im just with
you, its enough to keep me company
forever ^w^

             To Hailey,
	     The person I owe my life to
